SciJava Common is a common library for SciJava software. It provides a
plugin framework, with an extensible mechanism for service discovery, driven
by the SezPoz library, so that plugins can be loaded dynamically. It is used
by both ImageJ and SCIFIO.

This project also contains configuration files and scripts common to the
SciJava software stack:

* __bin:__ scripts that are commonly useful for many projects
* __pom-scijava:__ a Maven POM that serves as a base for all Maven-based
  SciJava code
