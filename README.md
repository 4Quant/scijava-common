SciJava Common is a common library for SciJava software. It provides a
plugin framework, with an extensible mechanism for service discovery, backed
by its own annotation processor, so that plugins can be loaded dynamically.
It is used by both [ImageJ](https://github.com/imagej/imagej) and
[SCIFIO](https://github.com/scifio/scifio).

This project also contains configuration files and scripts common to the
SciJava software stack:

* __bin:__ scripts that are commonly useful for many projects
* __pom-scijava:__ a Maven POM that serves as a base for all Maven-based
  SciJava code
